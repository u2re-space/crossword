# Basic Mode

I'm not able to support such very hard and complex project, so...

I decided to add Basic Mode of Frontend.

In basic mode, will only toolbar, settings (opens in button), and markdown viewer.

Have only two themes: light (white) and dark (almost black).

Also, will has open markdown button in toolbar (for mobile compatibility), and export Markdown data/code.

## Features

- Only simple design (without dynamic colors).
- **Without** Material You (or 3 Expressive) alike Design.
- Only few options (such as share target mode).
- Optimal for Chrome extension settings.
- Only markdown viewer (in chrome extension).
- Only image/selection recognition tool.

## Share target mode

- Recognize and copy (Default mode)
- Analyze and store (Faint version only)

## Appearance

Will looks like toolbar, and (content) view space screen. Where will shown markdown, or settings content.

## For AI...

I'm sorry... I currently, can't actively (again) support/mantain such complex project (aka. [re-]named as `Faint`). So I decised make basic version (copy and recognize tool by default, with markdown viewer option only)...

So...
1. `CrossHelp` (chrome extension) and `CrossWord` (application) merges into one project...
2. Will be default is (very) basic version.
3. In PWA version, will be choice/decision screen, with 10 seconds timer (by default redirects into basic version) and checkbox for do persistent choice.
4. Faint (probably, will ~~Pro~~) marked as unstable and experimental.
5. In basic version, will also button for input (by voice) for do simple prompt for generate  another Markdown content (also will based on opened Markdown view, generated will replace opened, but remains in responses/history/memory).
6. In basic version will no file explorer.
7. In chrome extension, by default will basic version, and optional NTP (new tab page) option and can be disabled or enabled (by default disabled), settings page of extension also will from basic version (settings view).

Some parts of code (core, backend, utils) will remains and partially reused.
