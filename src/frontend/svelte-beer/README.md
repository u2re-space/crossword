# Svelte + Beer CSS edition

**This is the alternative frontend implementation of the project.**

We just have no enough time to implement main version, so we are using this alternative version.

Event design will be different from main version, but will be compatible with core.

Based on our libraries and frameworks, we are using:

## Used frameworks and libraries:

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [Beer CSS](https://beer-css.github.io/)
- [Material Color Utilities](https://github.com/material/material-color-utilities)
    - (newer than [Material Dynamic Colors](https://github.com/leonardorafael/material-dynamic-colors))
    - Planned to make compatible with Beer CSS.
- [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/)
- [SortableJS](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable)
